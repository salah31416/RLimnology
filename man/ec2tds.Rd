\title{Electral Conductivity (EC) to Total Dissolvid Solids (TDS)}
\usage{
ec2tds(ec, k = 0.64)
}
\arguments{
\item{ec}{A numeric vector of EC (microS/cm)}

\item{k}{A TDS factor}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of TDS (mg/L)
}
\description{
Calculating total dissolved solids from a conductivity measurement in water
}
\details{
When calculating total dissolved solids from a conductivity measurement, a TDS factor is used. 
This TDS constant is dependent on the type of solids dissolved in water, and can be changed depending on 
the water source.
}
\examples{
## estimate 10 microS/cm ec to tds
ec2tds(10)
